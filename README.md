Welcome to Bartindre! 🔥🌴🍹💖🌴🔥 
=================================

So check this out. As the name implies this is ~~tinder~~, ~~bumble~~, but for ~~creeping~~ drinks. Cool! But instead of making a profile and caking on the charm you're creating drink profiles and hoping people like them. 

## Planned features:
- Liking and unliking drinks 👍👎
- Favorites functionality ⭐️ 
- Comments functionality 💭
- Adding friends functionality 👹
- JSON to dynamically add ingredient fields if the previous field has input ✏️
- User drinks page 🍹 🍸 🍾
- Edit user drink 💣

## Stretch goals: 💸
#####  🔘 $1M  Mobile swipe functionality
#####  ⚪️ $2M  Additional tropical backgrounds

Now you may be thinking *"Hey this guy is going to take all that funding and baboozle ALL of us investors!"* 
Well, you know what? **Maybe**.
